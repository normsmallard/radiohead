# radiohead
<h4>This is the dataset I used to make http://sixtamines.github.io/projects/radiohead/.</h4>
<p>
The information came from http://www.greenplastic.com/gigography/, but it was in a lousy HTML table so I had to do some wrangling to get it to play nice. Since my goal was to make a map, I looped through and hit the Google Maps API for lat/lon for each of these locations; there were only six or seven misses. Not bad!

<p>
I looked around briefly hoping to find someplace that had a nice API for snagging bands' tourdates. There might've been something on setlist.fm, but it looked like you have to apply for an API key and maybe more-- in any case, it was enough to send me elsewhere.
